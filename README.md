# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks to Predict Volatile Time Frames
* Built a model to predict specific periods of Volatility for two stocks: The Boeing Company (BA) & Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (ZM)
* Obtained Data from YahooFinance 

## The Boeing Company (BA) ##
* BA experienced a huge crash in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
* Using data from November 2017 I used my LSTM model to predict this crash:

## Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (ZM) ##
* ZM experienced large periods of volatility after the pandemic was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO)
* Before the pandemic, ZM had very slow market activity after initially trading publicly in April 2019. Trading at $107.47 just before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemicin March 2020, there was a huge spike in the share price. ZM saw a 425% rise in its stock price reaching an all-time high of $559 in October 2020.
